    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    Other than the simple fact that I'm human, I'm also a programmer. I've been
    doing Ruby and Rails since 2007. That's when the bleeding edge Rails was
    version 1.2.5.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm at the moment based in Singapore, an extension of getting my computer
    engineering degree there. After working for corporations for about two
    years, I finally had enough and figured out that it was not the way to move
    forward. In order to be a builder and crafter, I at least had to work in a
    software company or similar.
  </p>
  <p>
    And so began my journey up to now. It has taken me from someone who knew
    little about programming and the software development process to being able
    to build and deploy a web application from scratch using known best
    practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wrote blog posts about programming and
    <a href="http://blog.hendytanata.com">other topics</a> too. I have some open
    source works and have contributed to some. I also
    <a href="http://twitter.com/htanata">tweets</a>, though not so much. I'm
    doing freelance and consulting works on the side. Contact me if you're
    interested.
