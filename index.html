    Other than the simple fact that I'm human, I'm also a programmer. I've been
    doing Ruby and Rails since 2007. That's when the bleeding edge Rails was
    version 1.2.5.

    I used to work in Singapore, an extension of getting my computer
    engineering degree there. After working for corporations for about two
    years, I finally had enough and figured out that it was not the way to move
    forward. In order to be a builder and crafter, I at least had to work in a
    software company or similar.
  </p>
  <p>
    And so began my journey up to now. It has taken me from someone who knew
    little about programming and the software development process to being able
    to build and deploy a web application from scratch using known best
    practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently working in San Francisco Bay Area, also known as the
    Silicon Valley. The place has been great so far and I'm looking forward
    for more awesomeness.

    Recently I've been learning functional programming via Scheme, Scala,
    and Haskell. I am always amazed when I see how much
    <a href="http://scott.sauyet.com/Javascript/Talk/2014/01/FuncProgTalk/">less code</a>
    you can write with it and how
    <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/recursion#quick-sort">beautiful</a>
    it is. It's like a mini enlightenment for me. I also learned about alien
    concepts like partially applied function, point-free style, tail
    recursion optimization, pattern matching, function composition, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    I write <a href="https://codeftw.blogspot.com/">blog posts</a> about
    programming and <a href="https://blog.hendytanata.com">other topics</a>
    too. I have some <a href="open_source.html">open source works</a> and have
    <a href="open_source.html#open_source_contributions">contributed</a> to some. I also
    <a href="https://twitter.com/htanata">tweets</a>, though not so much. I'm
    doing freelance and <a href="works.html">consulting works</a> on the side.
    Contact me if you're interested.
